## Description

This notebook provides an end-to-end demonstration of **Brazilian E-commerce analytics: Sentiment Classification using machine learning**. The scope of topics discussed in this notebook includes data analysis & machine learning (supervised classification, imbalanced dataset problem, hyperparameter tuning, threshold moving, etc.) 

This notebook also serves as a part of graduation requirement from Job Connector Data Science program by Purwadhika.

## Problem Statement

* TELCO is a fictional telco company that proveded Internet service & otherservices. 
* From the data we understand that TELCO has churn customers. 
* TELCO want to understand why customer churn, from there the telco can prevent or reduce the occurrence of churn
* TELCO needs a model to classify which customer will churn so they can do preventive act to prevent customer to churn.

To answer those questions : 
1. What metrics to use ? 
2. What is the best model to be used for those cases ?
3. How's the model performance ? 
4. Conclusion & Recommendation for TELCO ?
